# Web Dev JavaScript · Learn the Web

Interaction and effects on the web are spectacular when enhanced with 
the JavaScript programming language. Students create motion graphics and
 complex interactions to enhance the user experience after learning 
programming basics with activities like co-op games, interactive 
code-based quizzes, and programming challenges.

## Learn the Web

**Learning code doesn’t have to be confounding.**

There are too many topics and too many tutorials online. It’s hard to figure 
you which are up-to-date and even harder to figure out what order to 
follow them.

Learn the Web, is a structured, curated, living guide to web development for graphic 
designers—presenting the information in a logical, targeted order that 
goes from a basic mobile-friendly webpage to a complex multi-screen 
interactive website.

## Thomas J Bradley

I believe that everybody should perpetually learn, try, build, break, 
& fix things—the Open Web is the perfect platform for exactly that.
